# librpi_i2c

This folder contains a client API, implemented as shared library, for interacting with the I2C driver.  The API was designed to be similar and as easy to use as the SMBus Python module.

Note that currently any app using this client API needs to be executed as root to access the I2C device driver.

## smbus_read_byte_data

Reads one byte from a specific address and a specific register

## smbus_read_block_data

Reads a block of bytes specified at a specific address with a specific register

## smbus_write_byte_data

Write any uint8_t value at a specific address with a specific register

## smbus_write_block_data

Writes a block of bytes specified at a specific address with a specific register

## smbus_read_byte

Reads one byte directly from an I2C device that does not use register addressing.

## smbus_read_block

Reads a block of bytes directly from an I2C device that does not use register addressing.

## smbus_write_byte

Write any uint8_t value to an I2C device that does not use register addressing.

## smbus_write_block

Write a block of bytes to an I2C device that does not use register addressing.

## smbus_cleanup

Clean up I2C API resources
